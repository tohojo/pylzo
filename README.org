* Pure Python LZO decompressor

This is a pure Python implementation of a decompressor for the LZO format,
implemented at a [[https://bornhack.dk/bornhack-2019/program/#/event/implementing-the-lzo-decompression-algorithm][workshop at Bornhack]].

It's slow and verbose, so I won't recommend using it for anything critical, but
it can be used for testing and studying.

The implementation is in [[file:lzo_decomp.py]]; a test harness is in
[[file:lzo_test.py]] which can be used with the test vectors in test*.hex to test
this implementation, or anything else that reads compressed bytes from stdin and
writes it to stdout.
